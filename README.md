# Counting to 100 Game

## A Saturday Afternoon Project

This project is a simple web-based game designed to help my 5-year-old son practice counting to 100. It was created on a Saturday afternoon as a fun, interactive way to work on a skill his teacher had recommended he improve.

### Why

Instead of traditional flashcards or repetitive exercises, I wanted something my son could work on while I helped his other brothers.  It needed to self-grade, keep a history of what caused problems, and have colorful visuals and interaction. He and I sat down and had some fun deciding colors and reactions.

### Features

- Count from 1 to 100 in numbers or words
- Switch between number mode and word mode
- Streak counter with star visualization
- Point system to gamify improvement
- Tracks numbers that need more practice
- Game history to see progress over time

### Technical Details

This game is built using:
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

It's a simple, client-side application designed for ease of use and quick iterations as we experimented with different features.

### Not for Distribution

This project is not intended for wide distribution or use. It's a personal, educational tool created specifically for my son. While the code is here for reference, it's tailored to our specific needs and learning goals.

### A Note to Other Parents

While you're welcome to look at the code for inspiration, the real value was in the process of creating something together. If you're looking to help your child with counting or any other skill, consider turning it into a collaborative project. The time spent together and the personalized approach can make learning much more enjoyable and effective.
